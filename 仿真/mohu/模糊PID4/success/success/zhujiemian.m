function varargout = zhujiemian(varargin)
% ZHUJIEMIAN M-file for zhujiemian.fig
%      ZHUJIEMIAN, by itself, creates a new ZHUJIEMIAN or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = ZHUJIEMIAN returns the handle to a new ZHUJIEMIAN or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      ZHUJIEMIAN('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in ZHUJIEMIAN.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      ZHUJIEMIAN('Property','Value',...) creates a new ZHUJIEMIAN or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before zhujiemian_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to zhujiemian_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
